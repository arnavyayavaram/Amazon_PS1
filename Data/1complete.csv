1,"The Leica Q3 updates its predecessor with a higher resolution 60MP full-frame sensor, improved burst rates and the added the ability to shoot 8K/30p video. The camera brings back the stabilized 28mm F1.7 offered since the Q1."
2,"The Fujifilm X-S20 is a DSLR-style mirrorless camera with a 26MP X-Trans BSI-CMOS sensor. Unlike other Fujifilm X-series cameras, it has a more traditional control layout and a larger grip. It uses the same sensor as the X-T4 and X-S20 with upgrades to the image stabilization system, processor, and AF system. The camera can shoot bursts at 30 fps with a crop, 20 fps without using the electronic shutter, or 8 fps with the mechanical shutter and can sustain bursts longer thanks to its UHS-II card slot and faster processor.  The camera has a mode dial rather than the shutter speed and exposure compensation dials found on other X-series models. It also has a pop-up flash. The built-in OLED viewfinder has a magnification of 0.62x and resolution of 2.36 million dots. The LCD is fully articulating and touch-enabled. A mic input is built in, and headphones can be used using the 3.5mm jack on the grip. The camera can be powered over its USB port. The camera can capture 6K open gate footage, 4K (DCI and UHD) for more than 30 minutes, with more runtime if you add the FAN-001 cooling fan accessory. Lovers of high-speed video can shoot at up to 240 fps by dropping down to Full HD. The X-S20 supports F-Log and F-Log2, 10-bit 4:2:2 internal recording, and compatibility with Blackmagic RAW and ProRes RAW using an external recorder."

15,"The Fujifilm X-T5 is our favorite APS-C camera for stills photographers. It's fast, well-designed, and capable of class-leading image quality. However, video quality isn't its strong suit and there are slightly more reliable autofocus systems for the money. Good for: Still photographers, including portrait, wildlife, travel, and landscape shooters. Anyone who desires a rugged, high-resolution camera with classic charm. Not so good for: Videographers and hybrid shooters."
16,"Ideal for advanced amateurs and featuring user-friendly functions, the EOS R6 Mark II camera is a high-performance hybrid camera that’s designed to capture decisive moments in both photo and video formats. It will satisfy a wide range of needs including professional production, vlogging, still pictures, filmmaking, and more.

17,"The new Alpha 7R V offers 61.0MP still images plus the most effective 8-step image stabilization system ever offered in any of Sony’s Alpha cameras, as well as refined 8K movie recording, a new 4-axis multi-angle LCD monitor, high-speed communication functions, high-level operability and smooth workflow integration. Sony’s newest camera is ideal for professionals who need a first-class high-resolution imaging tool. The Sony a7R V is a high resolution mirrorless camera, combining an excellent sensor with a powerful autofocus system in a body refined over multiple generations of improvement. It lends itself to a wide range of photography, from portraiture and landscape work to wedding and events. Its cropped, slow readout 8K video is the only real weakspot in an otherwise hugely capable camera. Good for: A broad range of photography requiring high resolution. Not so good for: Work that puts equal emphasis on video and stills."
18,"The OM-5's balance between durability, capability, and portability is hard to match anywhere in the photography world. Although it lacks bleeding-edge performance, for the money this model gives beginners a lot of bang for the buck. It can take great-looking stills, has some of OM System's famed computational photography features, and can shoot good enough video in a pinch, all while snapping away in snow and rain. Good for: Landscapes, vacation snapshots, and vlogging all in inclement weather. Not so good for: High-grade video capture or fast-moving sports."
19,"The ZV-1F is a camera aimed at vloggers and others who want to film themselves. It features vlog-friendly features such as a wide, 20mm equivalent lens, a good microphone with a detachable wind screen, and Sony's 'product showcase' mode, which automatically detects when you're holding an object in front of the camera and focuses on it. Still photographers intrigued by the idea of a compact camera with a wide angle lens for travel or street use take note: the ZV-1F doesn't capture Raw images, so you may want to look elsewhere. Good for: Vlogging, video capture, and social media. Not so good for: Users who need advanced video features or still photographers who want to capture Raw images."
20,"The compact, very accessible FX30 brings up-and-coming visual storytellers into the world of Sony’s highly acclaimed Cinema Line cameras. Drawing on cinematic colour science with S-Cinetone™ and S-Log3 for grading, it produces stunning cinematic imagery while incorporating a full array of workflow-efficient features."
21,"The Fujifilm X-H2 is the brand's first model to make the jump to 40MP, the highest-resolution APS-C sensor to date. Image quality is class-leading, while the build quality and ergonomics are nothing short of pro-level. Full-sensor 8K video is highly-detailed, though quite prone to the effects of rolling shutter, limiting its use to mostly static scenes. And Autofocus performance is generally good, even if there's some room for improvement compared to the competition. Good for: Landscape, studio, and portrait shooters who want the highest possible resolution APS-C camera available. Documentary filmmakers shooting static scenes. Not so good for: Video scenes with movement or panning. Those who don't need 8K video."
22,
23,"The Nikon Z30 is clearly designed with content creators in mind, particularly those intending to film vlogging-style content. It captures 4K/30p video from the full width of the sensor and 1080p video at 120 fps. Lens options are sparse, but it's paired with a respectable 16-50mm (24-70mm equiv) vibration reduction (VR) kit lens that's great for casual run-and-gun shooting. It will work for casual still images, but you're probably better off going with the Z50 for stills photography considering it has an EVF. Good for: Vlogging, streaming and social media content. Not so good for: Advanced video production or stills photographers (you're better off with the Z50, which has an EVF)."
24,"The X-H2S is Fujifilm's most ambitious X-series camera yet, and one of its most adaptable. Its AF system isn't always a match for its most extreme burst speeds but with a little tuning it can deliver impressive hit-rates. The video is also excellent, with features and performance that keep pace with more expensive cameras. It's not cheap but there are few options that can match its performance, for the price. Good for: Action photography, high-end video shooting Not so good for: Photographers who don't need its performance features"
25,
26,"The EOS R10 is perfect for content creators looking to take their creativity to the next level. Featuring a high-speed shooting 15 FPS mechanical shutter1,2, a 24.2 Megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor, and lightning fast autofocus, the EOS R10 camera brings some of the best features from the growing EOS R Series to a sleek, lightweight design. Users looking to learn the craft of photography and video, not break the bank in the process and want a no-fuss fun camera to tool around town should give the R10 a serious look, but be aware of the availability (or otherwise) of lenses. Good for: Beginners to intermediates and anyone with interest in casual HDR video Not so good for: Sports photographers or for capturing video intended for editing"
27,"The Lumix GH6 is Panasonic's next-generation video-focused Micro Four Thirds camera. It will use an all-new sensor and image processor, and will be capable of 10-bit 4:2:2 4K/60p capture with no time limit. It can also capture 10-bit 5.7K/60p and 4K/120 footage. It's expected to ship later in 2021. The GH6 is a flexible and dependable video camera that offers all its modes in a wide selection of codecs and bit-rates. The sensor that delivers excellent video falls behind its best stills rivals, making it a less successful hybrid camera than its predecessors, and AF still presents challenges in video. Overall a dependable video production tool that's a pleasure to work with. Good for: Small budget video projects Not so good for: Photographers"
28,"The OM-1 is a new flagship camera released by OM Digital Solutions under its new OM System brand. The OM-1, whose name page homage to the original OM-1 released 50 years ago, features 20.4MP Micro Four Thirds stacked CMOS sensor with 5-axis in-body image stabilization and two high-resolution modes capable of outputting 50MP and 80MP images in a special Tripod High Res mode. It's also quite capable on the video front, with support for 4K video (UHD or DCI) at up to 60 fps and Full HD (1080p) video at up to 240 fps, both internally in H.264 (8-bit) or H.265 (10-bit) codecs. Olympus has also doubled down on its weatherproofing expertise by adding enough weather-sealing to qualify this camera for IP53 dust- and splash-resistance. The OM-1 brings speed, improved AF and more detailed video to a system that already offered great image stabilization and small and light camera/lens combinations. This makes it a powerful all-rounder with particular strengths for wildlife. That compactness comes as a trade-off for absolute image quality but a series of computational multi-shot modes can help close the gap in certain circumstances. It's a lot of capability for the money. Good for: Wildlife, hand-held video, some sports shooting Not so good for: Family photos where simplicity is essential"
29,"The EOS R5 C is a video-orientated variant of Canon's EOS R5. Part of the Cinema EOS range, it shoots 8K at up to 60p in Canon's Cinema Raw Light format, with 10-bit 422 options in the XF-AVC format. The main distinguishing feature is an active cooling system on the back of the camera, allowing unlimited recording times. Unlike the base R5 model, there's no in-body image stabilization system, but there is a socket for syncing timecode. A three-way switch lets you turn the camera on in either Photo or Video mode, with the menus and user interface changing to match the mode you choose. Video mode includes wave form and vectorscope displays not included on the standard R5."
30,"The Leica M11 is a digital rangefinder camera built around a 60MP BSI CMOS sensor. It's the latest in Leica's 'M' series of rangefinders that dates back to the M3 from 1954. With this unrivaled depth of heritage behind it, it's no surprise that the M11 looks a lot like its predecessors. Despite the visual similarities, there's a lot that's changed in the latest model, with a more refined body design as well as completely new internals. The M11 will be available in two variants: a classic silver version with black leatherette band around the center and a brass top-plate, and a black version that uses aluminum instead, making it around 100g lighter. The recommended retail price for both is $8995."
31,"The Nikon Z9 is one of the most powerful cameras on the market, capable of up to 30 fps shooting in JPEG or 20 with Raw capture, and able to record 8K/30 video, with the promise of 12-bit Raw 8K/60 capture in a future firmware update. It's also one of relatively few cameras on the market to completely forego a mechanical shutter, a design decision made possible by the impressively fast read-out speed of the new sensor. The Z9 becomes the first Nikon mirrorless camera to offer the company's 3D Tracking AF system, which can be combined with the camera's machine-learning trained subject recognition system. The autofocus system has been trained to recognize three sets of subjects, covering people, animals and vehicles. In 'Auto' mode the Z9 analyzes the scene to detect subjects automatically, without you having to specify. The Z9 adopts the dual-grip form factor of a D6-level DSLR but shares the slightly more angular look of the existing Z-series cameras. Fully loaded with cards and batteries, the Z9 is around 8% lighter than Nikon's existing D6, and it is around 20% smaller in volume. It has a pull-out 2.1M-dot touchscreen that hinges both vertically and horizontally, for portrait or landscape orientation shooting. The Nikon Z9 is perhaps the most complete camera we've ever tested. It shoots excellent 45MP images at up to 30fps (20 with Raw), it captures 8K video in everything from 8-bit MP4s to 12-bit N-Raw. Its autofocus system is both powerful and easy to use and works well for both stills and video. It's larger and heavier than some of its rivals, which make it less well suited to some applications, but overall it combines the best of a DSLR and a video camera in a single body. Good for: Sports, photojournalism, wedding and events, video Not so good for: Travel photography where size and weight are critical."
32,"The a7 IV is an all-round capable camera, supporting the photographer in almost any situation. Its video capabilities live up to a similar standard, making it a hugely flexible imaging tool. Its extreme levels of customization can be daunting but its powerful autofocus system means it can be a very simple camera to use. Good for: Most photographic or video pursuits Not so good for: Sports photography"
33,"The Panasonic Lumix DC-BS1H is a video-centric full-frame mirrorless camera with a 'box' shape meant to be rigged up for various types of video shooting applications. Sharing a similar design as the DC-BGH1, this camera will be able to capture video at 6K/24p (3:2 aspect ratio), 5.9K/30p (16:9) and 10-bit 4K/60p. It features a V-Log/V-Gamut that can capture around 14 stops of dynamic range which, along with color and skin tones, is virtually the same as the company's professional VariCam. The BS1H has no recording limit for any of its video modes and takes larger Panasonic batteries for extended stamina. In addition to the lenses on Panasonic's L-mount roadmap, EF and PL-mount adapters will allow the use of additional lenses."
34,"The Ricoh GR IIIx is an ultra-compact camera with a 24MP APS-C sensor and 26.1mm (40mm equivalent) F2.8 lens. It has in-body image stabilization, a hybrid autofocus system, built-in neutral density filter, and a fixed touchscreen display (optical and electronic viewfinders are optional). It's capable of capturing Full HD video at 60 fps. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are also built-in."
35,"The Fujifilm GFX 50S II is a compact 51 Megapixel medium-format (44x33mm) camera that uses the company's GF-mount. It features in-body stabilization with up to 6.5 stops of shake reduction. Photos can be composed on a 3.2"" rear touch screen with a two-axis mechanism or on a large, high resolution EVF.  The 50S II has an updated autofocus system (though it's still contrast-detect), with more accurate face and eye detection. The camera has an OLED info display on its top plate and is highly customizable. The camera can create 205MP images by shifting its sensor, which can reduce false color. The body is weather-sealed against the elements. The GFX 50S II is the least expensive and most refined 50MP medium format camera yet from Fujifilm. Image stabilization boosts the range of circumstances it can be used in, helping it to deliver image quality at the very extreme of what full-frame is capable of. It's not the fastest camera on the market but it can make photography feel special and will deliver the best results this side of Fujifilm's 100MP models if you're shooting the kinds of photos it's strongest at. Good for: Landscape and studio work Not so good for: Sports and social shooting"
36,"The Fujifilm X-T30 II is an update to the original model that boosts performance and provides a higher resolution LCD. It sports a 26.1MP X-Trans sensor and X-Processor 4 Quad Core-CPU. It offers a hybrid AF system with 425 points across the entire frame, with both face and eye detection. It offers a 3"" 1.62M-dot tilting LCD and a 2.36M-dot OLED electronic viewfinder. The camera can capture both DCI and UHD 4K video and high-speed 1080 footage at up to 240 fps."
37,"The Sony ZV-E10 is an E-mount mirrorless camera with a 24MP APS-C sensor. The camera is designed for vlogging and features a fully articulating touchscreen, product showcase feature and soft skin features, a three-capsule microphone, and sockets for an external mic and headphones. It also has Sony's top-notch autofocus system, which tracks eyes and faces with ease. While it can capture 4K video, there's a hefty crop at 30p, but not at 24p. The ZV-E10 can live stream video (using UVC/UAC standards) over its USB-C connection. On the stills side, image quality is very good, bursts can be taken at 11 fps with continuous autofocus and battery life is best-in-class. While it lacks a mode dial, the camera is quite customizable. As a vlogging platform, the ZV-E10 seemingly has a lot to offer: it shoots oversampled 4K/24p video using the full width of its sensor, features a selfie touchscreen, a good built-in directional microphone, headphone/microphone ports and class-leading video autofocus. Battery life is also top of its class and the camera is livestream ready, out of the box. Unfortunately, 4K video capture results in a distracting 'jello effect' for clips with movement and/or fast action. And Full HD video shows poor detail capture compared to the competition. Good for: Vloggers and filmmakers shooting mostly static shots. Not so good for: Any form of vlogging that involves movement or capturing fast action. Stills shooters who want a viewfinder."
38,"The Nikon Z fc is an Z-mount mirrorless camera with a design reminiscent of the company's film cameras, such as the FM2.

The Z fc has a hybrid AF system with 209 phase-detect points, along with face and eye detection, for both people and animals. The camera can capture 4K/30p video plus high speed 120 fps footage at Full HD.  The Z fc has a fully articulating 1.04M-dot LCD as well as a 2.36M-dot EVF. It supports USB Power Delivery, which allows the camera to be operated when connected to a laptop charger or power brick. It has a single SD card slot and uses the same EN-EL25 battery as the Z50. The Nikon Z fc is an APS-C mirrorless camera that successfully brings back the design of the company's film cameras. It offers plenty of hands-on controls, a vlogger-friendly fully articulating touchscreen, excellent still and video quality, and plenty of customizability. It could use refinement in a few areas, but for those looking for an eye-catching camera that can capture the moment for social media and more, the Z fc is a solid choice. Good for: Those looking for a light, inexpensive and stylish ILC with direct controls and vlogging-friendly features. Not so good for: Those who prefer a more substantial-feeling body, best-in-class autofocus or a wider selection of native lenses."
39,"The Olympus PEN E-P7 is a rangefinder-style Micro Four Thirds mirrorless camera with a 20MP sensor and 5-axis in-body image stabilization. It has an downward-tilting 3"" touchscreen with 1.04 million dots, but with a flash instead of an electronic viewfinder. It has a 121-point contrast-detect AF system with face and eye detection. The E-P7 has numerous color modes, which can be easily accessed via a switch on its front plate. It can capture 4K/30p video at a bit rate of 102Mbps. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are built-in. It is sold body-only or kitted with a 14-42mm power zoom lens."
40,"The Panasonic GH5 II (GH5M2) is an updated version of the original that adds new video features, improved autofocus, and a new coating on its 20MP sensor to reduce flare and ghosting. The design and in-body image stabilization are unchanged. New autofocus algorithms allow for faster acquisition, face/eye/body/head detection, and improved tracking. The GH5 II can capture 10-bit 4:2:0 4K/60p footage while simultaneously outputting 10-bit 4:2:2 to an external recorder. Since the camera uses the whole area of the sensor, there is no crop at 4K/60p. The V-Log L gamut is built into the camera, and numerous LUTs for VariCam color profiles can be installed, and two Cinelike gammas are also onboard. The camera supports anamorphic and Full HD 120 fps capture. The camera can also live-stream video over YouTube at up to 1080/60p via a smartphone connection. The GH5 II's body is made of a magnesium alloy body and is weather-sealed and functions down to -10°C/+14°F. It has two SD card slots, both of which support UHS-II speeds. A new battery allows for longer shooting times, and USB PD support lets you power the camera using a laptop charger or portable power device. The GH5 II adds a fewer feature enhancements to one of the strongest stills/video cameras on the market. Autofocus is improved but is still a weak point for 24p video capture, taking the gloss of what's otherwise a superlative video camera. Excellent image stabilization and a broad range of video support tools still make it one of the strongest options for 4K shooting under $3000. Good for: 4K capture in a range of circumstances Not so good for: Run-and-gun shooting relying on autofocus"
41,"The Canon EOS R3 is a high-end full-frame mirrorless designed for sports, wildlife and photojournalism. It's built around Canon's RF mount and uses a 24MP Stacked CMOS sensor and a Digic X processor. The camera has a pro-level design with a built-in grip, and is as rugged as one would expect for its price. Photos can be composed on a 5.76M-dot 'blackout-free' HDR EVF or a high-resolution fully articulating touchscreen. The EVF has an optical viewfinder simulation mode that shows you the scene, rather than the expected output. It's most interesting feature is Eye Control AF, which moves the focus point to the location in the viewfinder that you're looking at. The R3 uses Canon's Dual Pixel AF system and can detect people, animals, and motorsports vehicles, and track them around the frame. The camera can shoot images at 30 fps (even Raw) using its electronic shutter.  Video-wise, the R3 can capture 4K footage produced from a 6K area of the sensor. 4K/120p is also an option, though it is not oversampled. C-Log3 and Raw video can be recorded internally. As one would expect, the camera has mic and headphone sockets, as well as a full-size HDMI port. The R3 has two memory card slots: one for UHS-II SD cards and the other for CFexpress Type B media. In addition to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, the camera also sports an Ethernet socket for connecting to PCs."
42,"The Sony a7R IV is the company's fourth generation, high-resolution full-frame mirrorless camera and is built around a BSI-CMOS sensor that outputs 60.2MP images. The ""A"" variant of the a7R IV is the same as the original model, but with a higher resolution (2.36M-dot) LCD. Despite its high resolution, it can shoot at up to 10 frames per second with full autofocus and shoot 4K video either from the full width of its sensor or from an APS-C/Super 35 crop. It also gains a 16-shot high-resolution mode that can be used to generate 240MP images of static scenes. The a7R IV has in-body image stabilization that's usable for still and video shooting. It has a top-notch autofocus system with face and eye detection that sticks to the subject, even if they look away or are momentarily blocked. It has a large, ultra-high-res electronic viewfinder, tilting touchscreen display and dual UHS-II SD card slots. The camera body is sealed against dust and moisture."
43,"The Sony a7R IIIA is a full-frame mirrorless camera that uses a 42.4MP stabilized BSI CMOS sensor. The Mark IIIA has numerous improvements over its predecessor, many of which are borrowed from the flagship a9. Faster processing and a redesigned shutter allow for 10 fps bursts (or 8 fps with no viewfinder blackout), and a refined autofocus system promises better subject tracking performance. The design hasn't changed much, with the main additions being a higher resolution EVF, joystick for adjusting the focus point, dual SD card slots and a higher capacity battery. Video can be captured at UHD 4K (30p) using the full-width of the sensor or a Super 35 crop, and 1080/120p option is also available. The a7R III supports S-Log3 and Hybrid Log Gamma profiles, among others. The ""A"" variant is the same as the original a7R III, except for the higher-resolution (2.36M-dot) LCD."

It shoot a DCI or UHD 4K video with internal capture at up to 400Mbps or a choice of 10-bit 4:2:2 or 12-bit Raw output over HDMI. The compact body is weather-sealed, has an OLED info displays on the top, and a fixed 3.69M-dot OLED viewfinder. Its dual-hinged 3.2"" LCD can tilt for both landscape and portrait photography. The camera has two SD card slots and ports for a mic, headphones and remote control. The Fujifilm GFX 100S is the smallest, least expensive way to achieve image quality beyond what full-frame can currently offer. You lose some responsiveness and flexibility in return for that, but as an image-making tool the GFX is excellent. It's also a surprisingly capable video camera but its smaller battery risks being more limiting than it is for stills shooting. Impressive in the studio and beyond. Good for: Landscapes, portraiture, studio work Not so good for: Fast-paced action and scenarios that require rapid responses"
47,"The Fujifilm X-E4 is a rangefinder-style mirrorless camera with a 26MP BSI-CMOS sensor paired with the company's exclusive X-Trans color filter. While has a ""flatter"" profile than its predecessors, there are still plenty of dials on the top plate. It has a 2.36M-dot electronic viewfinder as well as a flip-up touchscreen display.

The electronic shutter is designed to eliminate flicker and offers a flash sync of 1/200 sec (it's an impressive 1/400 sec with the mechanical shutter). A 'Pixel Shift Multi Shooting' mode combines 16 exposures into a 199MP image, which must be processed on a PC. Speaking of which, the camera can be controlled over dual band Wi-Fi, or tethered to a PC via USB or Ethernet. In addition to supporting the standard HEIF format, Sony has added a 'Light HIEF/JPEG' option for smaller file sizes. The a1 captures oversampled 8K/30p at a bit rate of 400Mbps as well as oversampled 4K at up to 120 fps. The camera can record 10-bit 4:2:2 video, and supports S-Cinetone, S-Log2/3, and HLG Log formats. 16-bit Raw recording to compatible external recorders is also available. The a1's body is designed to allow 30 minutes of continuous 8K recording. The a1 uses the NP-FZ100 battery with up to 530 shots/charge with the LCD and 430 with the EVF. A battery grip is optional. The Sony a1 is the most refined Alpha-series interchangeable lens camera yet. Its combination of speed and resolution for both stills and video set it apart in a crowded field of excellent options, though that combination is also responsible for the price it commands. But the fact remains, most any professional photographer will be able to use the a1 for most anything they'd think to shoot. Good for: Photographers capturing fast action, landscapes, weddings and events, portraiture and studio work or high-quality video. Not so good for: Photographers that don't need (or won't benefit from) the a1's combination of abilities. Those that need maximum resolution and dynamic range."

The X-S10 supports F-Log, 8-bit 4:2:0 internal recording, 10-bit 4:2:2 external recording and the company's popular Eterna color profile. The Fujifilm X-S10 is an excellent generalist photographers' camera. It has great image quality, strong video quality and features, and fast burst speeds for capturing fast action. Our only real reservation concerns its autofocus system, as the tracking performance has simply fallen behind what rival cameras are capable of. Otherwise, it proves to be a capable companion for landscape, portrait, travel photography and more. Good for: Generalist photography, including landscapes, portraits, studio work, run-and-gun video shooting. Not so good for: Sports and action specialists that need the best autofocus performance they can get."
55,"The Nikon Z6 II sits below the Z7 II as the flagship 'multimedia' model in the Z-series mirrorless lineup. Offering a 24MP full-frame sensor, in-body 5-axis stabilization and high-quality 4K video shooting, the Z6 II provides a similar feature set to its predecessor, but with some differences. Improvements include (and mostly stem from) the addition of a second Expeed 6 image processor, which allows for faster continuous shooting (now up to 14 fps) improved autofocus and 4K/60p video from an APS-C crop (coming via firmware). Physically the Z6 II is almost identical to the original Z6, but now features twin CFexpress / SD card slots, and provision for a vertical control grip (available separately). The Z6 II is a camera that does well at just about everything. It's comfortable to shoot with and its performance is reliably good. Its AF system is effective, though not at simple to use as its rivals', and battery life isn't particularly impressive, but if you're looking for an enthusiast camera that will do a bit of everything, it's well worth considering. Good for: Stills and video capture in a variety of situations Not so good for: Carefree shooting in fast-changing conditions"
56,"The Nikon Z7 II supplants the original Z7 as the highest-resolution model in the Z-series mirrorless lineup. Offering a 46MP full-frame sensor, in-camera 5-axis stabilization and high-quality 4K video shooting, the Z7 II provides a similar feature set to its predecessor, but with some differences.

65,"The Nikon Z5 is the company's entry-level Z full-frame Z-mount mirrorless camera. It has a 24MP CMOS sensor, 5-axis image stabilization and a hybrid autofocus system that has both human and animal detection. While build quality isn't to at the same level of the Z6, the camera is still weather-sealed. The Z5 has a 3.6M-dot electronic viewfinder and a tilting 3.2"" touchscreen display, and dual SD card slots that support UHS-II speeds. The Z5 can capture 4K/30p video, albeit with a 1.7X crop; Video captured at 1080 uses the full sensor area and has no crop. There are no high speed (e.g. 120 fps) modes on the Z5. The camera has both headphone and microphone sockets. The Z5 is powered by the new EN-EL15C battery and supports USB PD, which lets you power the camera with a portable battery pack. The same MB-N10 grip used by the Z6 and Z7 can be used on the Z5. The Nikon Z5 is arguably the best bang-for-your-buck stills-oriented camera on the market. Image quality from its 24MP sensor is just tad behind class-leading and much of its design, from the build-quality to the ergonomics, is borrowed from higher-end Nikon Z models. Autofocus performance is also solid; reliable face and eye detect make it a great choice for documenting family/friends. Video performance is the one area the Z5 does not excel: 4K video is heavily cropped. But it does offer respectable Full HD capture with the added benefit of in-body image stabilization for hand-held shooting. Good for: Just about anyone seeking a well-priced, stills-oriented full-frame mirrorless camera. Not so good for: Video shooters. Those wishing to capture super-fast action (in which Z5's 4.5 fps burst may not be quick enough)."

It offers dual-band Wi-Fi with support for real-time FTP transfer. The Canon EOS R5 is well-suited for just about any type of photographer, whether you shoot portraits, events, weddings, sports, family gatherings, and more. We've felt a bit let down by Canon's promises of the camera's outright video capability, but for most users, it's still a great option for getting good-quality video clips of almost anything you point it at. Power users that need the best video quality all the time won't be a good fit, but otherwise the EOS R5 is a fantastic option for almost anyone looking for a quality full-frame high-resolution mirrorless camera. Good for: Landscape, event, portrait, and wedding photographers, as well as sports photographers that can benefit from the camera's fast burst rate in its electronic shutter mode. Not so good for: Dedicated video users wanting the best video quality will be hampered by overheating; hybrid photo/video shooters that split their time but still need top-quality video."
68,"The Canon EOS R6 is an enthusiast-grade full-frame mirrorless camera. It's essentially a stripped-down version of the EOS R5, but appears to be very capable. The camera uses a 20MP CMOS sensor - the same as in the EOS 1D X Mark III -  with in-body image stabilization that can reduce shake by up to 8 stops. The camera uses the Dual Pixel AF II system, which has 1053 AF points across the entire frame. The R6 is capable of shooting bursts at 20 fps with its electronic shutter and 12 fps with the mechanical shutter, both with continuous AF. The R6 can shoot UHD and DCI 4K video at up to 60p, saved as either Raw or H.265 footage. 10-bit 4:2:2 internal regarding using C-Log and HDR PQ are supported.

It captures UHD 4K at up to 30p, 1080 at 60p, and high speed at up to 120 fps. It also has V-Log L built in.  The G100 uses a 20MP Four Thirds sensor, though it lacks in-body image stabilization like most Panasonic ILCs. It uses the company's Depth from Defocus contrast-detect AF system. The large field-sequential electronic viewfinder has an equivalent of 3.68 million dots. The camera can shoot as fast as 10 fps with continuous AF using its electronic shutter, or 5 fps with its mechanical shutter. It supports the optional DMW-SHGR1 selfie stick / mini tripod combination, which connects over USB. The G100 is designed to be a camera for vloggers and content creators but its severe crop in video (especially if you want stabilization) and its inconsistent AF undermine it for that task. It's a capable enough small interchangeable lens camera but one whose special features aren't particularly usable. Good for: Photography when you have to travel light Not so good for: Vlogging, if you need 4K or stabilization"
70,"The Sony Z-V1 is a variation of the RX100 VA that is squarely targeted toward vloggers. While it uses the same 24-70mm equiv. lens and 20MP 1"" sensor as that camera, the Z-V1 eschews the RX100 VA's pop-up viewfinder for a directional 3-capsule microphone. The mode dial is now a giant record button, and a tally lamp can be found on the front. The camera has Sony's latest autofocus system, including real-time eye AF. A background defocus function lets you quickly switch between two levels of background blur at the push of a button, even while recording. The Z-V1 has oversampled 4K video and Full HD to 120 fps. It supports HLG and S-Log2/3 for easier color grading. While it has a mic socket, a headphone jack is missing.

The ZV-1 is a solid option for vloggers and photographers looking for a compact camera with a fast lens and great video and still image quality. Its novel microphone and video-friendly ergonomics are big plusses, but we want to see Sony introduce a more modern touch interface and update their menus to appeal to a wider audience. Overall, whether you're a dedicated video maker or just want an easy-to-use camera for good quality clips, the ZV-1 is worth a look. Good for: Vlogging and video capture, travel photo and video, family photography. Not so good for: Users that need a longer zoom range and users that have no need for video or the video-focused features of this camera."

The camera supports the H.265 codec and can output 10-bit video at 4:2:2 over HDMI, or record internal 10-bit at 4:2:0. Fujifilm's F-Log format is supported, as are Film Simulation favorites like Eterna. The camera has a microphone socket, but a USB-C dongle is required to add a headphone jack. The X-T4 is one of the most expensive APS-C cameras available but also probably the most capable. Its autofocus system isn't quite as consistent or refined as the best of its rivals but in every other respect it excels. Its images are attractive, its video quality superb and it's engaging to shoot with. Good for: People shooting both stills and video Not so good for: Must-get-the-shot sports shooting"
72,"The Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark III is a high-end Micro Four Thirds camera with a 20MP sensor , in-body image stabilization with up to 7.5 stops of shake reduction and the same processor as the E-M1X. By shifting its sensor slightly, the E-M1 III can create 50MP stills, even while the camera is hand-held. Another trick the camera has is a Live ND function, while has the simulates the effects of a neutral density filter without actually needing a phsyical filter. The E-M1 III capable of shooting bursts of up to 18 fps with continuous AF and even faster with single AF. It uses the same hybrid autofocus system as the E-M1X, minus the train, car and airplane detection. The camera's magnesium alloy body is weather-sealed to IPX1 standards and has an updated dust reduction system and a shutter rated at 400k cycles.

On the video front, the G95 can capture UHD 4K video at 30p/24p with no official limit on recording time. Since the camera isn't using the full width of the sensor, there is a substantial crop when shooting 4K. The G95 has Panasonic's V-LogL gamma curve built in, and 8-bit 4:2:2 video can be sent to an external recorder. Both microphone and headphone jacks are included. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are available for remote capture and image transfer. The G95 is CIPA-rated to 290 shots per charge, though a power saving mode triples that number. A battery grip is optional. The Panasonic Lumix DC-G95/G90 is a good all-around mirrorless camera, though it doesn't stand out in any particular area. Its build quality is very good, with plenty of direct controls, in-body IS and an EVF that is much larger than those on its peers. Image quality is very good, though behind its competitors that use larger sensors. Video quality is fine in daylight, but falls behind when light is poor. In addition, a 1.25x crop when shooting 4K video doesn't limits your lens selection for wide-angle video capture. Good for: Those seeking a rugged, stills-focused camera for travel and photos of friends and family. Not so good for: Those seeking a light and portable camera; videographers and wedding photographers."

112,"The Leica Q2 updates its predecessor with a higher resolution full-frame sensor, splash and dust resistance on par with the SL's and an updated OLED viewfinder. The Q2 offers a 47.3MP full-frame sensor capable of DCI and UHD 4K video recording, and sticks with the stabilized 28mm F1.7 offered on the first Q. Bluetooth LE for easy connectivity has been added, and a higher capacity battery yields a CIPA rating of 370 shots per charge. The Leica Q2 is nearly as competent as a fixed-lens digital camera can be. It's built very well, it handles very well, it's capable of excellent image quality and it's a joy to use. We wish Leica would address the lackluster JPEGs, but the Raw files are excellent. It all comes at a price, of course, but the Q2 really is a wonderfully engaging photographic tool that will appeal to photographers of all kinds. Good for: Street, travel and casual photography as well as landscape photographers that make use of medium wide-angle lenses. Not so good for: Sports and action photographers that require longer focal lengths, and those that require a more robust video feature set."

118,"The Fujifilm X-T30 provides many of the features found in the higher-end X-T3, including its 26.1MP X-Trans sensor and X-Processor 4 Quad Core-CPU. It offers a hybrid AF system with 425 points across the entire frame, and boasts faster face detection compared to its X-T20 predecessor. The X-T30 is an altogether smaller and lighter camera than the X-T3 (383 g / 13.5 oz compared to 539 g / 19 oz) and offers a smaller, lower-resolution viewfinder. A 3"" 1.04M-dot touchscreen tilts on one axis, and a single card slot is offered. Burst shooting with continuous AF tops out at 20 fps (8 fps with mechanical shutter) and a lower native ISO of 160 is offered. The Fujifilm X-T30 is an exceptional value for the money, offering excellent image quality, a (generally) well-designed body with plenty of direct controls, and an autofocus system that handles most situations with ease, with face detection being a weak point. Video is a real highlight, in terms of both quality and controls, and offers features previously found on more expensive cameras. All-in-all, it's hard to go wrong with the X-T30, one of the best midrange cameras we've tested in a long time. Good for: Those seeking a lightweight camera with great out-of-camera image quality, flexible Raw files and top-notch video Not so good for: Those seeking best face and eye AF performance. Serious videographers who need the very best spec."

It features a 16MP CMOS sensor, 28-140mm equiv. lens, 2.7"" LCD with a new outdoor mode and 1080/30p video capture. The only difference between the WG-60 and the WG-50 that came before it is support for FlashAir wireless SD cards."
130,"The Leica M10-D is a rangefinder camera that has much in common with its sibling, the M10-P, but lacks an LCD and has a thumb rest styled as a film advance lever. If users want to change anything other than the shutter speed, aperture or exposure compensation, they'll need to do so via the Leica FOTOS app. The M10-D comes with a 24MP full-frame CMOS sensor and Maestro II processor and offers a top ISO of 50000 and a 5 fps burst rate. The M10-D has some degree of environmental sealing and lacks any I/O ports. An EVF is optional and is the only way in which users can briefly seen the photo they've just taken."
131,"The Zeiss ZX1 is a compact full-frame camera with a 37.4MP image sensor, fixed 35mm Distagon F2 lens and a huge 4.3"" touchscreen with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels to augment its physical controls. Zeiss has also teamed up with Adobe to offer full Adobe Photoshop Lightroom CC capability in the camera itself. The ZX1 is capable of capturing UHD 4K at up to 30 fps, and Full HD video at up to 60 fps. The ZX1 does not have a memory card slot, but does come with 512GB of internal memory, which the company claims is enough to store approximately 6,800 Raw files in DNG format (or up to 50,000 JPEG files). It will offer Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and USB-C connectivity. The company will also offer over-the-air software updates. The Zeiss ZX1 is an attractively designed camera with a lot to like in terms of image quality and the inclusion of Adobe Lightroom Mobile gives you an impressive amount of flexibility when editing your files on the camera. Lackluster autofocus and video capabilities, along with some occasional interface quirks and sluggishness detract from the overall experience. Good for: Travel, documentary and lifestyle photography as well as high-speed flash work. Not so good for: Photographers that already have an established editing workflow, those that need longer focal lengths or a more robust video feature set."
132,"The Fujifilm GFX 50R is the the rangefinder version of the company's SLR-styled GFX 50S medium format digital camera. It offers a 43.8 x 32.9mm 51.4MP CMOS sensor and uses new G-mount lenses, with a crop factor of 0.79x. It uses the same X-Processor Pro as the GFX 50S and has an 117-point contrast-detect autofocus system. The body is remarkably compact and lightweight for a medium format camera and it sports a 3.2"" tilting touchscreen and an ultra-high-resolution 3.69M-dot OLED electronic viewfinder with a magnification of 0.77x. The top plate has dials for exposure compensation and shutter speed, while 'swipe actions' on the LCD have replaced the four-way controller. The GFX has the usual Fujifilm Film Simulation modes, plus a new Color Chrome Effect option. It's also capable of capturing Full HD video at up to 30p. Unlike the GFX 50S, the 50R has built-in Bluetooth. The Fujifilm GFX 50R brings medium format digital photography down to a more attainable price point than we've seen before, and does so while offering exceptional image quality in a reasonably compact yet well-built body. The ergonomics suffer a bit from the smaller grip, and some competitors with smaller sensors suffer only a slight image quality hit while being more flexible overall. That said, the GFX 50R remains a joy to use, the images a joy to view, and it's an excellent way to get access to Fujifilm's lineup of GF medium format lenses. Good for: Discerning landscape and studio shooters that are on the hunt for the sharpest details they can feast their eyes on. Not so good for: Photographers of dynamic or moving subjects who need good continuous autofocus performance, and those looking to shoot video along with stills."
133,"The Ricoh GR III is a pocketable, lightweight camera with a newly designed 28mm equiv. F2.8 lens and 24MP APS-C sensor. It features a sensor-shift shake reduction system (which can also be used for simulating the effect of an anti-aliasing filter) along with a hybrid autofocus system. It has a 3"" touchscreen display (with support for an optical viewfinder), hot shoe, USB-C port with video output and built-in Wi-Fi plus Bluetooth. The GR III can capture video at Full HD video at 60 fps. The Ricoh GR III updates the GR series in some really important ways, bringing a modern high-resolution sensor and hybrid autofocus system to the lineup for the first time. Controls have been simplified, and a new touch-sensitive rear screen makes autofocus positioning and image navigation much faster. Image quality is excellent, although JPEG shooters might find that the 'Std' profile delivers rather dull results. The lack of a flash, and unimpressive battery performance are the only major black marks against this pocketable camera. Good for: Street shooting and casual photography, or travel photography where a small and light camera, with a medium-wide lens is very useful. Not so good for: Any work that requires long shooting sessions, long focal lengths, or low light shooting, where the GR III's autofocus system can struggle."
134,"The GoPro Hero7 Black was introduced alongside Silver and White Hero7 versions, and of the three cameras the Black offers the highest specifications. It records 4K/60p and 2.7K/120p video, as well as 1080p at up to 240 fps. It captures 12MP stills and unlike the Silver and White versions, uses a removable battery rather than built-in. The Hero7 Black also offers the first generation of the company's HyperSmooth digital image stabilization."
135,"The GoPro Hero 7 Silver launched alongside the higher-spec'd Black and budget-oriented White editions. The Hero 7 Silver features 4K/30p video recording, built-in GPS and 10MP stills. It uses a built-in rather than removable lithium-ion battery, and lacks the super slow-motion video modes offered by the Hero 7 Black."
136,"The GoPro Hero 7 White is a budget-friendly action cam that launched alongside the higher-spec'd Black and Silver editions. The Hero 7 White offers a more pared-down feature set including 1080/60p video recording, Wi-Fi + Bluetooth and 10MP stills. It uses a built-in rather than removable lithium-ion battery, and lacks the built-in GPS offered by the Black and Silver Hero 7s."
137,"The Canon PowerShot SX70 HS is a super-zoom point-and-shoot camera with a 65x, 21-1365mm equivalent F3.4-6.5 lens and 20MP BSI-CMOS sensor. The camera is powered by Canon's latest Digic 8 processor which allows for fast bursts and 4K video capture. As you'd expect, its long lens is stabilized, with up to five stops of shake reduction. Photos can be composed on a fully articulating 3"" display or a high-res OLED electronic viewfinder. The SX70 is Canon's first point & shoot camera to support its new CR3 Raw format. The SX70 can shoot continuously at 10 fps with single AF and 5.7 fps with continuous AF.  UHD 4K video can be captured at 30 fps, and a high speed 120 fps mode is available at Full HD resolution. Wireless connectivity includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth."
138,"The Fujifilm X-T3 is an enthusiast SLR-style mirrorless camera with a new 26MP BSI CMOS X-Trans sensor and updated hybrid AF system with 425 phase-detect points and nearly 100% coverage. The camera has the same analog controls for shutter speed, ISO and exposure compensation as the X-T2 before it, and nine buttons and dials are customizable. The X-T3 has a 3.69M-dot electronic viewfinder with a large 0.75x magnification as well as a touchscreen LCD that tilts on two axes. The tough magnesium-alloy body is sealed against dust and moisture and features twoSD cards that support UHS-II media. The camera shoots continuously at 20 fps (e-shutter) or 11 fps (mechanical shutter) at full resolution, or up to 30 fps in a 1.25x crop mode. Video can be captured at both DCI and UHD 4K at up to 60p, with a top bit rate of 400Mbps. The camera supports the H.265 codec and can output 10-bit video at 4:2:2 over HDMI, or record internal 10-bit at 4:2:0. Both F-Log and HLG are supported. Note that there is an ""X-T3 WW"" model that does not include a charger but costs $100 less. As a stills camera the X-T3 is a pleasant update to one of our favorite APS-C cameras, significantly improving the autofocus. If you're interested in stills and video, though, it's knockout. The lack of stabilization holds the video back a touch but as a compact, relatively affordable do-everything camera, it's impressive. Good for: A bit of everything, especially if that everything includes video. Not so good for: Sports shooting at the highest levels."
139,"The EOS R is Canon's first full-frame mirrorless camera. It features a 30.3MP CMOS sensor with Dual Pixel AF and an ISO range of 100-40000 (expandable to 50-102400). The EOS R can record both 14-bit (CRW) and compressed (C-RAW) formats. It can shoot continuously at 8 fps in single AF and 5 fps with continuous AF. The Dual Pixel AF system has a whopping 5655 selectable AF points and it can function at light levels as low as -6EV. The compact body has a 3.69M-dot OLED electronic viewfinder with a 0.76x magnification, as well as a 3.2"", 2.1M-dot fully-articulating touchscreen LCD. On the top plate is an OLED panel that displays current shooting information. The EOS R offers Mini-HDMI and USB-C ports, as well as a 3.5mm external mic socket. Battery life is CIPA-rated at 370 shots per charge (450 using Power Saving mode). A battery grip is available. The EOS R has a single memory card slot that supports UHS-II media. 4K UHD video can be captured at up to 29.97 fps using ALL-I or IBP compression with a max bit rate of 480MBps. If you want 60p video you'll have to drop down to Full HD. With a 30MP sensor, fantastic color reproduction and on-sensor autofocus, the EOS R can produce some beautiful photographs with pinpoint-accurate focus. But it's Canon's first mirrorless full-frame camera, and in many ways, it shows. The ergonomics feel unfinished, and for the same or less money, you can find better video, more dynamic range and faster burst speeds elsewhere. But we have to admit that Canon's new RF lenses are simply spectacular, and at this time, the EOS R is the only way to get to use them. Good for: General and social photography, casual video shooters and those looking for either a backup body for their full-frame Canon glass or are looking at building up a collection of new RF lenses. Not so good for: Those looking to shoot sports or fast-moving subjects, those needing the absolute best image quality for either landscape or video work."

142,"The Nikon D3500 is the company's entry-level DSLR camera. It's essentially the same as its predecessor, the D3400, except that it now uses the same body as the D5600. It continues to have a 24MP APS-C CMOS sensor, EXPEED 4 image processor, Full HD video capture and an easy-to-use interface. The camera has an ISO range of 100-25600, an 11-point autofocus system and can shoot continuously at 5 fps. The camera's Guide Mode makes it easy to learn how to shoot in various situations. While it doesn't have Wi-Fi, the D3400 has Bluetooth connectivity for transferring images from the camera to a smartphone, albeit slowly. The D3500 is a compact and likeable DSLR for beginners. It's not great for video and its image transfer is slow. But for stills it's a solid choiceand its Guide Mode makes it easy to learn. Good for: Beginners who want the DSLR experience Not so good for: Video shooters or anyone expecting a phone-like 'WYSIWYG' shooting experience."
143,"The Nikon Z 7 is the company's high-end full-frame mirrorless camera. It features a 45.7MP BSI-CMOS sensor, a hybrid AF system with 493 points and 90% coverage and 5-axis in-body image stabilization.

An OLED panel on the top plate displays current shooting settings. Photos are stored on an XQD card. The Z 7 can shoot continuously at 9 fps with AE locked and 5.5 fps with continuous AF/AE. The buffer is relatively small, topping out at 18-23 Raw and 25 JPEG images. It can capture 4K video using the full width of the sensor, or users can switch to a DX crop mode where the entire sensor is sampled. You can use the same features for videos as you can for stills, including 5-axis IS and the hybrid AF system (with 435 points here). The Z 7 supports focus peaking, zebra patterns, time code and 10-bit Log output over HDMI. The camera can record 8-bit video internally and externally at the same time.  Connectivity options include Wi-Fi (802.11ac) with Bluetooth as well as the ability to connect directly to a PC. The Nikon Z7 is an extremely well-rounded digital camera and suitable for a wide range of photographic and video needs. It packs outstanding image quality and very good 4K video in a lightweight, well-built package with in-body image stabilization. Autofocus is less reliable than the competition and the buffer can be limiting for fast action, but overall, the Z7 is a pleasure to shoot with. Good for: Hybrid stills and video shooters, photographers looking for a versatile tool for a wide range of subjects in a compact package. Not so good for: Those needing class-leading autofocus performance, faster burst rates, or greater buffer depth."
144,"The Nikon Z6 is the company's midrange full-frame mirrorless camera. It features a 24.5MP BSI-CMOS sensor, a hybrid AF system with 273 points and 90% coverage and 5-axis in-body image stabilization. The rugged body is similar in design to the D750/D850 DSLRs and is fully sealed against dust and moisture. It features a 3.68M-dot electronic viewfinder and tilting 3.2"", 2.1M-dot touchscreen LCD. An OLED panel on the top plate displays current shooting settings. Photos are stored on an XQD card. The Z6 can shoot continuously at 12 fps with AE locked and 5.5 fps with continuous AF/AE. It can capture oversampled 4K video for maximum resolution. You can use the same features for videos as you can for stills, including 5-axis IS and the hybrid AF system (with 435 points here). The Z6 supports focus peaking, zebra patterns, time code and 10-bit Log output over HDMI. The camera can record 8-bit video internally and externally at the same time.  Connectivity options include Wi-Fi (802.11ac) with Bluetooth as well as the ability to connect directly to a PC. The Nikon Z6 is a well-built full-frame mirrorless camera that produces excellent stills and 4K video. Autofocus is reliable most of the time, including during burst shooting, though selecting a subject on which to track is clumsy. The camera's built-in image stabilization works well on native and 'classic' Nikon glass. Battery life isn't class-leading, and some improvements related to manual focus in video should be addressed, but overall Nikon has a winner in the Z6. Good for: Everyday shooting, video Not so good for: Sports and action"
145,"The Panasonic DC-LX100 II is an enthusiast compact with a 17MP Four Thirds sensor that allows the camera to maintain the same field-of-view at 16:9, 3:2 and 4:3 aspect ratios.

The LX100 II has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, with the latter maintaining a constant connection that allows for quick remote control and auto image transfer. The LX100 II is a small, engaging enthusiast compact. Its bright 24-75mm equivalent lens and multi-aspect design make it highly flexible. Only the cropped video and slightly basic viewfinder stop this lightly-refreshed camera reasserting itself as a clear leader in this class. Good for: Enthusiasts looking for an enjoyable always-with-them tool Not so good for: Anyone needing something truly pocketable"
146,"Leica's M10-P is the more expensive sibling to the M10. The differences between the M10-P and M10 include the lack of a 'red dot' on the front as well as the addition of a touchscreen LCD, electronic level and quieter shutter mechanism. The M10 comes with a 24MP sensor with a top ISO of 50000. The Maestro II processor has 2GB of buffer to provide 30 Raw images or 100 JPEG images to be captured at 5 fps. The M10-P has some degree of environmental sealing and lacks any I/O ports. It does have Wi-Fi support, however."
147,"The PowerShot SX740 HS is an ultra-compact camera with a long 40x zoom lens.

148,"The Fujifilm XF10 is an enthusiast compact with a 24MP APS-C-size CMOS sensor and 28mm equiv. F2.8 lens. It has a 91-point hybrid autofocus system, 6 fps burst shooting and 4K/15p video capture. The body has twin control dials, a fixed 3"" touchscreen LCD, a built-in flash and a socket for an external microphone. The Fujifilm XF10 takes great photographs and looks great doing it, but has too many caveats for us to wholeheartedly recommend. Overall operation is sluggish and autofocus just isn't reliable, which is unforgivable at this point considering how capable smartphones have become. But the lens is sharp, the sensor excellent and the colors gorgeous. In short, the XF10 can provide you with beautiful results, but you better pack your patience. Good for: Street photographers using 'snap focus', landscape shooters looking for a lightweight photographic companion and generalist photographers that have enough experience to work around the camera's limitations. Not so good for: Shooters that require consistently accurate autofocus, those looking to capture unexpected decisive moments and those who already have the latest smartphones that - in most cases - will be good enough."
149,"The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 Mark VA is an updated version of the fifth camera in Sony's popular lineup of 1"" enthusiast compacts. The ' VA' model gains a deeper buffer, new white balance, metering and autofocus options, and the ability to save 720p proxy footage along with 4K video. Support for Sony's PlayMemories Apps has been removed. Features that carryover include on-sensor phase detection AF and a burst rate of 24 fps with full-time focusing. The AF system has the same 25-pt contrast-detect system with 315 PDAF points that cover 65% of the frame. 4K video is oversampled without pixel binning and saved using the XAVC S codec. The RX100 V(A) continues to offer a 20.1MP 1""-type stacked CMOS sensor, 24-70mm F1.8-2.8 lens, pop-up EVF and built-in Wi-Fi w/NFC."

The lens features 1 Super ED and 5 ED elements as well as an image stabilization system that reduces shake by up to 5 stops. With the lens extended the camera is 181mm / 7.2"" long and it weights 1.4kg / 3.1 lbs. The camera has a hot shoe as well as flash sync port. The P1000 uses a 16MP, 1/2.3"" CMOS sensor with an ISO range of 100-6400 and Raw support. Photos can be composed on a 3.2"" fully articulating LCD (not touch-enabled) or a 2.36M-dot OLED viewfinder. Video can be captured at UHD 4K/30p and 1080/60p (as well as several high speed modes) with manual exposure and clean HDMI output. Wireless features include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The Nikon Coolpix P1000 is all about its incredible zoom range. If you need a focal length of 3000mm, it's the only game in town. If you don't need that much zoom then there are far better cameras for equal or less money. Good for: Capturing the moon and still wildlife from incredible distances. Not so good for: High image quality for most situations, focusing on moving subjects,  a long day of shooting"

Rounding out a travel-friendly feature set are 4K video, Wi-Fi with Bluetooth, and 5-axis optical+electronic image stabilization."
152,"The Cyber-shot RX100 VI is a 1""-type compact camera with a 24-200mm F2.8-4.5 zoom lens, 315 phase detection points and the ability to shoot at 24 fps with autofocus. It's the first in the Cyber-shot RX100-series to offer a touchscreen, allowing both touch shutter and touch focus. The screen can tilt up to 180 degree upwards and 90 degree downwards, extending shooting flexibility.  The Mark VI includes the latest Bionz X processor with front-end LSI, helping give what the company says is the world's fastest AF (measured at 0.03 seconds) and with twice the EyeAF tracking performance of the Mark V. The new 24-200mm zoom lens offers a claimed 4EV of image stabilization. The RX100 VI is a very capable camera, combining a flexible zoom range with impressive autofocus. However, the small maximum aperture required to keep the size down limits the image quality in some situations. The relatively high price means you have to really want its unequaled combination of capability and size. Good for: Anyone needing fast AF, good video, sharp images and a flexible zoom range in a pocket-sized package. Not so good for: Anyone seeking the best possible image quality in dim light or with moving subjects."
153,"The Fujifilm X-T100 is a midrange SLR-styled mirrorless camera.

It has a 24MP CMOS sensor, a hybrid autofocus system with 91 phase-detect points, Fujifilm's well-liked Film Simulation modes and 4K/15p video capture. The X-T100 is equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for easy photo sharing. The Fujifilm X-T100 is a SLR-style mirrorless camera with excellent photo quality plus a unique articulating LCD, high-res viewfinder and great battery life. However, its autofocus subject tracking abilities are disappointing, with only 15 fps recording at 4K and overall poor video quality. Good for: Travel, portrait and landscape photographers who want excellent image quality, an articulating LCD and top-notch selection of lenses. Not so good for: Capturing anything moving or recording video. Shooting bursts of Raw images."
154,"The Panasonic Lumix DC-TS7 (known as the FT7 outside of North America) is the first compact rugged camera to feature an electronic viewfinder (as of May 2018). The camera is waterproof to 31m/102ft, shockproof to 2m/6.6ft, pressure resistant to 100kgf/220lbf and freezeproof to 10°C/-14°F. It pairs a 20.4MP BSI-CMOS with a optically stabilized 28-128mm equivalent F3.3-5.9 lens. The main attraction is a 0.2"" electronic viewfinder with 1.17M-dot equivalent viewfinder for shooting outdoors. There's also a 3"" LCD display with 1.04 milliion dots. The camera can record 4K video at 24p or 30p and has a high speed 120 fps mode, albeit at 1280 x 720. Wi-Fi is built in, though the TS7 doesn't offer Bluetooth like many other modern Panasonic cameras. Battery life in rated at a respectable 300 shots per charge."
155,"The Sony a7 III is a 24MP full frame mirrorless camera that incorporates many of the features and improvements found in the a7R III. Primary among these are a BSI sensor, along with the larger capacity 'Z' battery, AF joystick and the company's impressive EyeAF feature. Its 693-point AF system offers 93% frame coverage. Continuous shooting is offered at up to 10 fps with mechanical shutter, and 5-axis in-body stabilization claims a 5.0 stop shutter speed advantage. Video recorded at 4K/24p is taken from a 6K region of the sensor, while 30p shooting comes from a roughly 5K region with a 1.2x crop. The camera offers both S-Log2 and S-Log3 gamma curves for shooting wide dynamic range scenes or Hybrid Log Gamma for playing back directly on high dynamic range displays.  The new larger-capacity battery boasts 710 shots per charge. The a7 III uses the same 2.36m dot OLED viewfinder as its predecessor, giving a 1024 x 768 pixel view, rather than the higher-res version in the a7R III. The viewfinder is complemented by an articulated 3"" 921k-dot LCD. The Sony a7 III is a well-priced, well-rounded camera suitable for all kinds of photography. Twenty-four megapixels of resolution is more than sufficient for most tasks, and the 693-point autofocus system and 10 frames-per-second burst speed help the a7 III keep up with fast action. Video quality and feature set is another strong point, though some operational lag, a slightly low-resolution viewfinder and unintuitive video autofocus may turn off some users. Good for: Generalist photographers, wedding, event and action shooters and those that need high quality video. Not so good for: Those that need more resolution for detailed scenes or large prints, those that need ultimate build quality for harsh shooting conditions."

With select lenses it offers Dual Pixel coverage of 88% x 100% and 143 AF points, with other lenses offering 80% x 80% coverage and 99 AF points. The M50 is the first Canon camera to use the CR3 Raw format, allowing for up to 50% smaller file sizes. The M50 is capable of taking burst at 7.4 fps with continuous autofocus for up to 10 Raw or 47 JPEGs. The M50 has a fully articulating 3"" touchscreen LCD with 1.04 million dots as well as an OLED electronic viewfinder with 2.36M dots. It can record 4K UHD video at 30p, albeit with a substantial crop and no Dual Pixel AF. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. As a stills camera, the EOS M50 is a solid choice for photographers who want something more advanced than an entry-level camera, without going overboard. Its image quality, improved AF system and wireless connectivity are all impressive, and the new C-Raw format is a nice bonus. If 4K video is what you're after, the M50 is not the camera for you due to its high crop factor, rolling shutter and mediocre AF performance. Good for: People on the go who want something compact, with good connectivity and an accessible interface. Not so good for: Anyone interested in 4K video capture. Those without easy access to a power outlet and don't want to carry a pocket full of batteries."

As before, it features a 36.4MP full-frame CMOS sensor without an AA filter and is stabilized using Ricoh's SRII Shake Reduction system. This five-axis shake reduction system is capable of reducing camera shake with a compensation range of up to five shutter steps. SRII also allows the PENTAX K-1 to incorporate other features such as Pixel Shift Resolution, which effectively eliminates moiré without the need for an anti-aliasing filter, increasing sharpness and overall image quality. A new Dynamic Pixel Shift mode allows for handheld high-res photos by using the small movements of your hands to capture the four images that are combined. The K-1 II continues to use the SAFOX 12 autofocus mechanism with 33 autofocus points, and a Flexible tilt LCD monitor which can be adjusted to the desired angle horizontally and vertically without deviating from the lens’s optical axis, making it easy to shoot at challenging angles. It also has the same Operation Assist Lights – compact white LEDs that facilitate camera operation in low-light environments, making it easy to change lenses, swap memory cards and adjust back-of-camera controls, and a Smart Function dial that allows photographers to easy select frequently-used functions without going into the LCD menu. The Pentax K-1 II  features a stabilized 36MP Full Frame sensor and one of the toughest-built bodies on the market. Jam-packed with unique features to aide those shooting under harsh conditions, we're big fans of its many control points and great ergonomics. However, its image quality offers no improvement over that of its predecessor. Its autofocus performance and video capabilities also lag greatly behind the competition. Good for: Landscape and adventure shooters needing a camera as tough as they are. Still life and macro photographers. Not so good for: Those wishing to photograph sports, action or active children. Video shooters. Those seeking an unobtrusive and/or light camera body."

The X-H1 is a camera able to adapt to a wide variety of shooting situations, with excellent image quality, very good video performance and solid autofocus performance. As usual, the camera's color in its JPEGs and movie footage is one of the highlights. Our only real concern is the camera's failure to excel in any respect, especially in the light of the competition available at this price. Good for: Someone looking for a video/stills all-rounder Not so good for: Anyone looking for the perfect tool for one specific job"
161,"Panasonic's GX9 is a 20MP interchangeable lens Micro Four Thirds camera. Its sensor does not use a low-pass filter in an effort to maximize sharpness, and an L/Monochrome D Photo Style is included for fans of black-and-white film. The GX9 does not offer weather-sealing, unlike the GX8 and G9. The GX9 offers a 2.7 million-dot (equiv) EVF that tilts 90° upward, and a 1.2 million-dot touchscreen that tilts up 80° and down by 45° – a departure from the G9 and GX8's fully articulated screens. An electromagnetic drive claims to reduce shutter shock by 90%, an attempt to mitigate the shutter-induced softness we saw in previous GX-models. The camera relies on contrast detect autofocus with the help of Panasonic's Depth from Defocus technology when Panasonic lenses are used.  Naturally 4K/30p/24p video is present with all of the affiliated 4K Photo Modes, including two new ones: Auto Marking and Sequence Composition. Auto Marking allows the camera to identify movement in a 4K clip and set a marker to quickly jump to the action, and Sequence Composition makes it easy to create composite images of action in-camera. In-body 5-axis stabilization combines with dual-axis optical stabilization, resulting in a claimed 4-stop reduction in shake. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are available for quick image sharing. With its compact size, robust feature set, abundant controls and overall responsiveness, the Panasonic Lumix DC-GX9 is a great camera for all kinds of photographers. The trick tilting viewfinder is a neat touch (though we wish it were larger), and limited battery life remains a sticking point. But impressive in-body image stabilization, a pleasing JPEG engine and good quality 4K capture mean the Lumix GX9 is a camera we can easily recommend. Good for: Street photographers, travel photographers who don't mind carrying an extra battery with them, enthusiasts that enjoy abundant controls and those who want great JPEGs right out of the camera. Not so good for: Hardcore landscape and sports shooters that may need greater dynamic range, resolution and burst speeds."

Like its predecessor the ZS200 offers a 3"" touchscreen, accompanied by an upgraded 2.3 million-dot EVF with 0.53x magnification.  Contrast detect autofocus is aided by Panasonic's very good Depth from Defocus technology, and up to 10 fps burst shooting is available with AF-S (6 fps in AF-C). Rounding out a travel-friendly feature set are 4K video, Wi-Fi with Bluetooth, 5-axis image stabilization and a new L.Monochrome Photo Style for a black-and-white film look. The Panasonic Lumix DC-ZS200/TZ100 packs a 24-360mm equiv. lens into a body that fill fit into all but the skinniest pockets. Its time-tested sensor produces high quality photos, its autofocus system is snappy, 4K video generally good and battery life strong. However, there is a 1.5X crop in 4K video that also increases noise, a lens that tends to be soft, and an EVF that some may find bothersome. For those who want a long lens, compact body and 1"" sensor, the ZS200 is one of the better choices out there. Good for: Travelers who want a telephoto lens in a small package, and to be able to share photos quickly and easily. Not so good for: Those who wish to capture video at wide-angles. Sports, portrait or low light shooters. Those sensitive to field sequential EVFs."

The screen now tilts and also features touch capability. Weather sealing is improved over the D7200 as well, and weight has been reduced to 640 grams. The D7500 is an outstanding stills camera and a refinement of an already excellent DSLR. It brings added speed and buffer depth to the  enthusiast level and adds improved subject recognition. More comfortable to hold than its predecessor, the addition  of a tilting touchscreen only adds to the camera's excellent ergonomics.  And while 4K video is a nice selling point, the 1.5x crop and crummy video AF dim its appeal for movie makers. But for stills shooters, the D7500 is one beast of a camera. Good for: Sports and action shooters. Anyone looking for a traditional, well-featured DSLR for stills shooting. Not so good for: Videographers. Travel photographers who might be happier with a smaller, lighter body."

Wireless features include Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth. The Canon EOS 77D is a well-rounded and well-sorted camera. The ergonomics are great, Live View performance is superb and Dual Pixel Autofocus continues to impress. The viewfinder is a little on the small side and it still doesn't shoot 4K video, but as an all-around package for the enthusiast photographer, the EOS 77D deserves a look. Good for: Enthusiasts and amateurs who are looking to take more control over their photography, and those looking to capture video with ease. Not so good for: Sports and peak action shooters, videographers who must have the highest quality footage."

The ACROS film simulation mode is new, as is an electronic shutter that tops out at 1/32000 sec. As one would expect, Wi-Fi is a standard feature. The X100F's combination of image quality, usability and styling make it the best in the series yet. It's still a niche camera, but this latest version's limitations stem primarily from its design, rather than its implementation. A true photographers' camera. Good for: Photographers who want to revel in and be challenged by shooting with a fixed lens, fixed focal length camera. Not so good for: Anyone looking for flexibility or immediacy. Or video."
199,"The Fujifilm X-T20, the follow-up to the X-T10, now sports a 24MP X-Trans APS-C CMOS sensor, improved image processor, and new autofocus algorithms.

The X-T20's continuous AF system can struggle in low light, and subject tracking is inconsistent. 4K video quality isn't the greatest, and capture controls are limited. Despite that, the X-T20 is a first-rate mirrorless camera and a great value, to boot. Good for: Photographers seeking a stylish camera with direct controls, excellent image quality and a great selection of lenses. Not so good for: Action photographers and those requiring ultra-high-quality 4K video."
200,"Leica's M10 is the slimmest digital M-series camera yet. As thin as a film-era M4, it is also 20 grams lighter than the M Typ 262. The big upgrades are under the hood, as the M10 comes with a newly designed 24MP sensor that offers improved dynamic range and high ISO performance, the latter of which now goes to an expanded value of ISO 50000. There's also a new, speedier Maestro II processor with 2GB of buffer to provide 30 Raw images or 100 JPEG images to be captured at 5fps. Leica has added some degree of environmental sealing and though they've eliminated any I/O ports, the M10 gains Wi-Fi capability. The addition of a bigger viewfinder, improved Live View performance and a dedicated ISO dial round out a refreshingly intuitive, back-to-basics experience."
