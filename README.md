## Product Attribute and Specification Extraction from Web

### Named Entity Recognition using BERT

- Utilized BERT for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on unstructured text to identify the Brand and Model of products.

### Knowledge Base (KB) Development

- Developed a knowledge base (KB) of product brands and models by extracting details from product, manufacturer, and review webpages.

### Predictive Metric for Shipping Cost

- Created a predictive metric to assess the health of shipping cost for an item.

### Best Performing Regression Models

- The best performing regression models for predictive metrics were:
  - LGBMRegressor
  - HistGradientBoostingRegressor
  - RandomForestRegressor

### Tools and Technologies

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Spacy
- **Machine Learning**: BERT, LGBMRegressor, HistGradientBoostingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor
- **Web Framework**: Django REST Framework

This project involved applying machine learning techniques and web scraping to extract product attributes and specifications from unstructured text on e-commerce websites, with a focus on Brand and Model recognition. Additionally, predictive metrics were developed to assess shipping costs, and various regression models were evaluated to determine the best performing model.
